Hey there! I'm Ibón, a first-year PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder. I got my BSc in Aerospace Engineering in the Technical University of Madrid, Spain, and my MSc in Systems & Control in Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. My previous research involved formal strategy synthesis of uncertain systems through Markovian abstractions, obtaining performance guarantees. I also have some experience working as a Flight Control Systems Engineer at Capgemini. My interests include sequential decision-making under uncertainty, formal methods, safety-critical systems and machine learning. In my free time I enjoy playing and listening to music, exercising (specially cycling, fitness, swimming, volleyball, hiking) and watching movies.
