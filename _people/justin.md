I am a graduate student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research occupies the fusion of multi-robot task and motion planning, fault robust decision making, and human interpretable artificial intelligence. In my spare time, I maintain an active outdoor lifestyle by constantly seeking trails to explore, mountains to snowboard down, and sports to play.
