Hello, my name is Ada. I am a junior at CU Boulder, currently pursuing my BS degree in Aerospace Engineering. My interests in space exploration and autonomous systems have led me to explore robotics and safety systems. One of my goals is to learn about general robotic systems and understand research development as I continue in completing my degree. In my free time I enjoy hiking, watching movies, and baking.
