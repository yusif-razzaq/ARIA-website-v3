<p>I’m Daniel, a senior undergraduate majoring in aerospace engineering at CU Boulder. I’m beginning to take graduate courses, and will continue into the masters program at the completion of my BS. I’m working on interfacing robot simulation and control, and I’m excited to learn about decision making facing conflicting objectives. In my free time I enjoy reading poetry &amp; nonfiction, running, and cooking for friends &amp; family.</p>
