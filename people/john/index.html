<p>Hey! I’m John, a PhD student in aerospace engineering at CU Boulder. My research interests include formal synthesis and verification, analysis of multi-agent networks, and applications of reliable autonomous systems. My current research is focusing on control synthesis for nonlinear systems with only partial knowledge of the dynamic model. I finished my undergraduate and master’s degrees at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My extracurricular interests include maintaining my bike and my car, hiking when it is too cold out, and crossing books off my reading list.</p>
