<p>Hello, I’m Richard, a Masters student in the Aerospace Engineering program at CU Boulder. My main interest is learning about how the human thinks, specifically choosing observations and making decisions in time-critical situations. My current research is formally synthesizing a policy under uncertainty for a suggestive advanced driving assistance system in a semi-autonomous vehicle in a safety-critical situation using a cognitive model and sensors to infer human driving intention. The reason I’m here with the ARIA Systems Group is because my ideology aligns with the current direction of the group; if the possibility exists to rigorously prove something, we should rigorously prove it instead of just assuming its validity.</p>
