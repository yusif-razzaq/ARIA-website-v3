<p>Hey, I am Karan, a Ph.D. student in the Aerospace Engineering Dept. at CU. I did my undergrad in India and Masterâ€™s in Mechanical Engineering at CU Boulder. At ARIA Systems group, I work on developing theories and algorithms that enable robots to operate safely, robustly, and efficiently in unknown and dynamic environments. Currently, I am working on <em>Synthesizing</em> high-level strategies for a robot operating in the presence of humans using game-theoretic approaches. I have also worked on <em>Verifying</em> the safety of complex systems modeled as neural networks and guaranteeing their safety using Barrier Methods for Safe Autonomy. My current research interest includes Formal Methods, Verification and Planning for Autonomous systems, Game Theory, and Control Theory.</p>
