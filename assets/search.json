After a few years in the nuts and bolts (literally) of instrument prototyping and testing, I decided to move out to Boulder to pursue an MS in aerospace engineering. My work as an MS student stayed on theme with an atom-based inertial sensing project, but my contributions shifted to the controls side. Now I am exploring a wicked exciting new direction for my Ph.D. with the ARIA System Group.

I am a first year master’s student studying Aerospace Engineering with a focus on autonomous systems at the University of Colorado Boulder. I spent my undergraduate years here at CU Boulder as well, receiving a degree in Aerospace Engineering with a double minor in Mathematics and Physics. Throughout my undergraduate career, I became more and more intrigued by problems in computer science. I found a hidden passion for solving complex engineering and computer science problems by designing efficient and modular algorithms. Halfway through my junior year, I joined the ARIA systems research group. Within the first month or two, I realized that I had found a field of study that combined all of my technical and career interests. After working on a few simple projects and implementations, I decided that I wanted to shift the direction of my graduate studies to autonomous systems.\n\nThroughout my time with ARIA I have been involved in multiple projects and collaborations such as generating discrete model abstractions, designing a low level action-execution architecture for robotic manipulators in ROS, creating an efficient formal synthesis toolbox in C++, as well as my personal research.\n\nI am part of a five-person group project named COLDTech (funded by NASA) that is aimed towards extending safe, autonomous capability to a remote space lander with low-bandwidth, high-latency communication to Earth. My contributions to this project include theoretical development of the on-board task-planner. My current research is focused on synthesizing a high-level plan that efficiently satisfies a set of task preferences while respecting a user-defined priority for each task. This would allow a group of scientists on Earth to uplink only a prioritized set of tasks to the lander, after which the lander is autonomously responsible for synthesizing a high-level plan. The plan must allow the lander to efficiently satisfy all of the tasks while aiming to complete higher priority tasks before lower priority tasks.\n\nThis research would extend the capabilities of robots and other autonomous systems under scenarios where multiple tasks are given.\n\nResearch Keywords: Formal synthesis, planning with preferences, hybrid systems, formal methods\n\nCheck out a few videos of my implementation work with robitic manipulators:\n\n  Franka Emika arch construction\n  My senior project (Sierra Nevada Corp.)\n\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to contact me at: peter.amorese@colorado.edu\n",

This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

Therefore, we are working on new multiagent planning approaches that minimize the effort it takes a human to verify the paths.\n\nMulti-agent motion planning (MMP) is the problem of finding a motion plan for multiple agents such that when these agents are run simultaneously, none of the agents collide. These motion plans are traditionally computed using provably correct algorithms and immediately executed on a real system. In safety-critical applications, however, a human supervisor may want to verify that the plan is indeed collision-free prior to execution. This process can be extremely unintuitive since MMP solutions commonly have intersecting lines, making it difficult to verify that the agents do not collide. The inability for humans to validate traditional MMP algorithms leaves a huge trust-gap between motion planning experts and the daily-users who could benefit from using such algorithms. This work focuses on shortening the gap by incorporating explainability into traditional MMP algorithms.\n\nWe investigate the notion of an explanation for a plan of MMP, based on visualization of the plan as a short sequence of images representing time segments, where in each time segment the trajectories of the agents are disjoint, clearly illustrating the safety of the plan. Presenting the plan in this way makes it very easy for a human to recognize the plan is collision free because recognizing line intersections happens very early in the cognitive process. Giving MMP algorithms the ability to explain their solutions to humans would greatly shorten the trust-gap between motion planning research experts and daily-users of these algorithms, consequentially allowing MMP algorithms to be further utilized within safety-critical systems.\n\n",

        "content": "This project addresses the need to balance competing objectives for multi-agent autonomous systems in exploration of an environment. We aim to provide formal guarantees on performance and resource consumption objectives by using formal analysis techniques.\n\n\n\nThis research seeks to address the challenge of generating safe, correct, and verifiable optimal plans. This is achieved by using formal methods to provide guarantees on the objectives studied in an optimal tradeoff analysis. The scenario consists of a set of autonomous agents that can make opportunistic relative measurements of each other (ex. range to other agents, imaging, etc.). These measurements can be communicated with at least some subset of the network. This communication improves state estimation, increasing the probability of satisfying objectives, but also consumes resources. The agents seek to satisfy three mission objectives: 1.) navigate to a goal state, 2.) avoid obstacles, and 3.) minimize resource use. The problem is to find the optimal tradeoff between these competing objectives, which can be captured in a Pareto front. Pareto analysis via formal methods will provide a major advance by allowing users to reason over task objectives rather than implementations.\n\nThe novel aspect of this research comes from the application of event triggered estimation. Event-based state estimation is primarily used in systems where resources need to be conserved. Instead of continuously sharing measurements or estimates, the system uses a trigger to decide when new information is worth sharing. There is no analytical method to determine the appropriate threshold for triggering; it must be painstakingly tuned to achieve the desired performance. This research in formal tradeoff analysis offers a way to automatically generate an optimal schedule for the triggering threshold.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more, please reach out to Anne Theurkauf at anne.theurkauf@colorado.edu.\n",

After a few years in the nuts and bolts (literally) of instrument prototyping and testing, I decided to move out to Boulder to pursue an MS in aerospace engineering. My work as an MS student stayed on theme with an atom-based inertial sensing project, but my contributions shifted to the controls side. Now I am exploring a wicked exciting new direction for my Ph.D. with the ARIA System Group. I work on navigation and objective planning for collaborative multi-agent systems exploring the lunar surface. We use formal methods to generate decision making strategies that maximize both mission value and safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQi Heng Ho\n\n\n\n    PhD Candidate, \n    qi.ho@colorado.edu\n    Hey there!

    "content": "ARIA Systems group develops novel theoretical foundations and computational frameworks to enable reliable and intelligent autonomy. The main theme of our work is safety and soundness, and the emphasis is on safe autonomy through correct-by-construction algorithmic approaches. Our research builds on knowledge developed in control theory, formal methods, statistical reasoning, and machine learning &amp; AI to address real-world challenges in robotics and safety-critical systems.\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n\n    \n    \n    Verifiable Control Synthesis through Model-based Learning with Safety Guarantees \n    \n    \n    We are combining formal control synthesis and machine learning to tackle uncertainty in autonomous systems applications. By carefully considering the error in the learning process, we aim to develop novel methods for safe control that can adapt to changes in the system and environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Explainable Multi-Agent Planning \n    \n    \n    As we begin employing teams of robots to accomplish complex tasks, it becomes difficult for a human to verify that future paths do not result in collisions. Therefore, we are working on new multiagent planning approaches that minimize the effort it takes a human to verify the paths.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Expert-Informed Autonomous Science Planning for In-situ Observations and Discoveries \n    \n    \n    In this project, we are developing a framework to maximize science obtained by robotic landers in future space missions on the surface of distant bodies such as Europa. The key challenges we address is to reduce the dependency of human-in-the-loop operations and changes in the environment for limited-time missions by developing correct-by-construction algorithmic approaches that integrate formal method, game theory, and control theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    INPASS: Intelligent Navigation, Planning, and Awareness for Swarm Systems \n    \n    \n    This project addresses the need to balance competing objectives for multi-agent autonomous systems in exploration of an environment. We aim to provide formal guarantees on performance and resource consumption objectives by using formal analysis techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Safe driver assistance systems through cognitive modeling and reactive synthesis \n    \n    \n    This project studies the application of formal methods to the verification of a human driver model built using the cognitive architecture, and to the design of correct-by-construction Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Mapping and motion planning for safe autonomous navigation \n    \n    \n    In real-world robotics, motion planning remains to be an open challenge. Not only robotic systems are required to move through unexplored environments, but also their maneuverability is constrained by their dynamics and often suffer from uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Correct-by-Construction Controller Synthesis using Gaussian Process Transfer Learning \n    \n    \n    This project explores improvements to embedded control software for safety-critical cyber-physical systems with applications in autonomous transportation, traffic networks, power networks, and aerospace systems. These systems often have complex dynamics that are difficult to obtain in a closed-form and ensure their safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Enabling Long-term Marine Robotic Autonomy, from Learning Specifications to Autonomous Navigation and Interaction \n    \n    \n    In this project, we explore the challenges of developing smart and safe long-term autonomy for underwater vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Human-Aware Strategy Synthesis for Robotic Manipulators \n    \n    \n    As robots gain capabilities to enter our human-centric world, they require formalism and algorithms that enable smart and efficient interactions. In this project we explore games as a powerful modeling framework for robotic manipulators. Further, we synthesize reactive strategies efficiently for the robot to have meaningful interactions with the human and ensure task completion whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\nPast Work\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    Resource-performance trade-off for mobile robot design \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    Specification revision with optimal satisfaction guarantees \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    Decision making and Planning in partially unknown environments \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    Planning for probabilistic robots with complex missions \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    Automatic control synthesis from high-level specifications \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    Verification and synthesis for stochastic hybrid systems \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n",
