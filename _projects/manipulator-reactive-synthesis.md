As robots gain capabilities to enter our human-centric world, they require formalism and algorithms that enable smart and efficient interactions. In this project we explore games as a powerful modeling framework for robotic manipulators. Further, we synthesize reactive strategies efficiently for the robot to have meaningful interactions with the human and ensure task completion whenever possible.

As human-robot collaboration is scaled up to more and more complex tasks, there is an increased need for formally modeling the system formed by human and robotic agents. Such modeling enables reasoning about reliability, safety, correctness, and scalability of the system. The modeling, however, presents a daunting task. This research aspires to formally model scenarios where the robot and the human can have varying roles. The intent is to develop scalable methodologies that will endow the robot with the ability to adapt to human actions and preferences without changes to its underlying software or hardware.

The project is a critical step towards making robots collaborative with and responsive to humans while allowing the human to be in control. This research will develop a framework for human-robot collaboration that integrates reactive synthesis from formal methods with robotic planning methods. By tightly combining the development of synthesis methods with robotics, it will pursue the development of a framework that is intuitive and scalable. The focus is on task-level collaboration as opposed to physical interaction with a human.
