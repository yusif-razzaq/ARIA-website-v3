This project studies the application of formal methods to the verification of a human driver model built using the cognitive architecture, and to the design of correct-by-construction Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).

<!--more-->

Research into safety in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles has, so far, largely been focused on testing and validation through simulation. Due to the fact that failure of these autonomous systems is potentially life-endangering, formal methods arise as a complementary approach.

The aim is to create a rigorous framework for the design of ADAS in semi-autonomous vehicles that accounts for the congestive process of the driver.  To illustrate the validity of the approach, various driving scenarios will be studied, including multi-lane highway driving scenario that the interactions that arise.
