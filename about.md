We are a group of robot enthusiasts in the Departments of Aerospace Engineering Sciences and Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder set on developing **A**ssured, **R**eliable, and **I**nteractive **A**utonomous (ARIA) systems.  We envision a world where autonomous systems operate safely and effectively alongside humans and form trusting partnerships to improve the well-being of individuals and societies.  This vision drives our research in developing theoretical foundations and computational frameworks that enable reliable and intelligent autonomy.  We view this as an art, a creative process that requires deep technical understandings of the fields that contribute to robotics. 

The main theme of our work is safety and soundness, and the emphasis is on safe autonomy through correct-by-construction algorithmic approaches.  Our research builds on knowledge developed in control theory, formal methods, statistical reasoning, machine learning & AI and seeks to address real-world challenges in robotics and safety-critical systems.
